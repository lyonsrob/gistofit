The analysis assumes a worst-case emissions scenario in which we won't make significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through 2080. </p>\n<p>Climate Central projected summer high temperatures for 1,001 cities, and then showed which city in the U.S. or worldwide already experiences those summer temperatures today.</p>\n<p>Some of the results are striking. Assuming current emissions rates continue, Boston's average summer high temperatures could be more than 10 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they are now, making the city as mild as Miami Beach is today, the report found. Summers in inland locations may warm more, since ocean temperatures increase more slowly. Helena, Montana, for example, could jump by nearly 12 degrees Fahrenheit, making it feel like Riverside, California.</p>\n<p>Some of the statistics presented in the report are frightening if you hate hot weather and live in the northern areas of the U.S. </p>\n<p>For example, the report found:</p>\n<p>\"In some cases, summers will warm so dramatically that their best comparison is to cities in the Middle East. Take Las Vegas, for example. Summer highs there are projected to average a scorching 111 degrees Fahrenheit, which is what summer temperatures are like today in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. And at 114 degrees Fahrenheit, living in Phoenix will feel like summering in sweltering Kuwait City.\"</p>\n<p>Notably, the analysis only describes summer high temperatures, and does not incorporate changes to humidity levels, which contribute a great deal to how uncomfortable hot weather feels, and how dangerous heat waves can be. </p>\n<p>Recently, a <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/06/24/global-warming-business-leaders/\">climate report</a> was released that found that increased heat and humidity is likely to be a significant drag on the U.S. economy in the coming decades because it will limit the amount of time that outdoor work, such as construction, can take place. </p>\n<p>Other studies have shown that mean annual average temperatures of typical locations on the planet <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/one-billion-people-face-entirely-new-climate-by-2050-study-16587\">will soon depart completely from even historical extremes</a> and into entirely new territory in some parts of the world. That research, however, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v502/n7470/full/nature12540.html\">was challenged last week</a> by a prominent group of climate researchers who say that it's calculations are inaccurate. </p>\n<h2>6 major climate change myths, debunked</h2>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2BtSmC24vyo\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"></iframe></p>\n<em>Have something to add to this story?
